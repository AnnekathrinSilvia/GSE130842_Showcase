IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS, CAUSES AND BIOFORTIFICATION STRATEGIES OF SE-DEFICIENT RICE, THIS STUDY COLLECTED DATA FROM THE PUBLICATIONS ON THREE THEMES: MARKET SURVEY, FIELD SAMPLING AND CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE MARKET SURVEY, GLOBAL RICE SE CONCENTRATIONS WERE 0.079 MG/KG ON MEAN AND 0.062 MG/KG ON MEDIAN. EAST ASIA HAS A HUMAN SE INTAKE GAP DUE TO THE REGION'S HIGH RICE CONSUMPTION AND THE LOWEST RICE SE CONCENTRATION IN MARKETS GLOBALLY. TOTAL SE CONCENTRATIONS IN EAST ASIAN PADDY SOILS WERE FOUND TO BE ADEQUATE BASED ON THE FIELD SAMPLING. HOWEVER, OVER 70 % OF EAST ASIAN PADDY FIELDS WERE INADEQUATE TO YIELD RICE THAT MET THE GLOBAL MEAN FOR RICE SE CONCENTRATION. THE SE-DEFICIENT RICE WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY WIDESPREAD LOW SE BIOAVAILABILITY IN EAST ASIAN PADDY FIELDS. THERE WERE TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING RICE SE ENRICHMENT INCLUDING ROOT SE UPTAKE AND IRON OXIDE IN SOILS. CONCENTRATING ON THESE PROCESSES IS BENEFICIAL TO RICE SE BIOFORTIFICATION. SINCE SE IS ADEQUATE IN THE PADDY SOILS OF EAST ASIA. RATHER OF ADDING SE EXOGENOUSLY, ACTIVATING THE NATIVE SE IN PADDY SOIL IS PROBABLY A MORE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR RICE SE BIOFORTIFICATION IN EAST ASIA.

RECENT EVIDENCE HAS EMPHASIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE OF MICRORNA (MIRNA)-MRNA NETWORKS IN VARIOUS CHRONIC WOUNDS, INCLUDING DFU. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO CLARIFY THE MIRNA-MRNA AXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF DFU. EXPRESSION PROFILES OF MIRNAS AND MRNAS WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE GENE EXPRESSION OMNIBUS. DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES AND DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED MIRNAS WERE IDENTIFIED, AND MIRNA-MRNA REGULATORY AXES WERE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH INTEGRATED BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES. WE VALIDATED THE MIRNA-MRNA AXES USING QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR (QPCR) AND DUAL-LUCIFERASE REPORTER ASSAYS.

VARIOUS MECHANISMS, INCLUDING SURFACE ION COMPLEXATION, HYDROGEN BONDING, AND ELECTROSTATIC FORCES, CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS ONTO MPS, WITH FACTORS LIKE SURFACE AREA AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE DURATION PLAYING CRUCIAL ROLES. ADDITIONALLY, BIOFILM FORMATION ON MPS ALTERS THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, INFLUENCING METAL ADSORPTION BEHAVIORS. DIFFERENT THERMODYNAMIC MODELS ARE USED TO EXPLAIN THE ADSORPTION MECHANISMS OF HEAVY METALS ON MPS. THE ADSORPTION PROCESS IS INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MPS, THEIR ADSORPTION CAPACITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE DESORPTION OF HEAVY METALS FROM MPS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR BIOAVAILABILITY AND POSES RISKS TO MARINE ORGANISMS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF SOURCE REDUCTION AND REMEDIAL MEASURES. HYBRID APPROACHES THAT COMBINE BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND MODERN TECHNOLOGIES SHOW PROMISE FOR THE EFFICIENT REMOVAL OF MPS AND HEAVY METALS FROM MARINE ENVIRONMENTS.

KE AND EW DIPEPTIDES ARE ACTIVE SUBSTANCES OF THYMALIN. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT KE STIMULATES CELLULAR IMMUNITY AND NONSPECIFIC RESISTANCE IN ORGANISMS, EXERTING AN ACTIVATING EFFECT ON MACROPHAGES, BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES, THYMOCYTES, AND NEUTROPHILS, WHILE EW REDUCES ANGIOTENSIN-INDUCED VASOCONSTRICTION AND PRESERVES ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASCULAR RELAXATION BY INHIBITING ACE2, THE TARGET PROTEIN OF SARS-COV-2. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM OF THE IMMUNOMODULATORY ACTION OF THYMALIN, KE, AND EW DURING COVID-19 REMAINS UNCLEAR. TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF ACTION UNDERLYING THE IMMUNOMODULATORY ACTIVITY OF THYMALIN AND ITS ACTIVE COMPONENTS, EW AND KE DIPEPTIDES, WE ASSESSED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EW AND KE DIPEPTIDES AND DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA (DSDNA) WERE INVESTIGATED BY MOLECULAR MODELING AND DOCKING USING ICM-PRO. ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF EW AND KE DIPEPTIDES ON GENE EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF COVID-19 WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE USE OF BIOINFORMATICS METHODS, INCLUDING A SEARCH FOR PROMOTER SEQUENCES IN THE EUKARYOTIC PROMOTER DATABASE, THE DETERMINATION OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COVID-19 USING THE PATHCARDS DATABASE OF HUMAN BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS (PATHWAY UNIFICATION DATABASE), IDENTIFICATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROTEINS THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS IN THE STRING DATABASE ('SEARCH TOOL FOR RETRIEVAL OF INTERACTING GENES/PROTEINS'), AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL ENRICHMENT OF PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION (PPI) USING THE TERMS OF GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) AND THE MARKOV CLUSTER ALGORITHM (MCL). AFTER THAT, IN VITRO STUDYING OF A LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS)-INDUCED MODEL OF INFLAMMATION USING HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS WAS PERFORMED. ELISA WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF CYTOKINES (IL-1Β, IL-6, TNFΑ) IN THE SUPERNATANT OF CELLS WITH OR WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF EW AND KE PEPTIDES. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED FROM FOUR DONORS; FOR EACH CYTOKINE, ELISA WAS PERFORMED 2-4 TIMES, WITH TWO PARALLEL EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL SAMPLES FOR EACH EXPERIMENT (EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF PEPTIDES ON LPS-STIMULATED CELLS WERE REPEATED FOUR TIMES, WHILE ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS WITH UNSTIMULATED CELLS WERE PERFORMED TWO TIMES). USING MOLECULAR DOCKING, GGAG WAS FOUND TO BE THE BEST DSDNA SEQUENCE IN THE CLASSICAL B-FORM FOR BINDING THE EW DIPEPTIDE, WHILE GCGC IS THE PREFERRED DSDNA SEQUENCE IN THE CURVED NUCLEOSOMAL FORM FOR THE KE DIPEPTIDE. CLUSTER ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT POTENTIAL TARGET GENES FOR THE EW AND KE PEPTIDES ENCODE THE AKT1 AND AKT2 PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CYTOKINE STORM. THE SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR THE EW PEPTIDE ARE THE   AND   GENES, AND SPECIFIC TARGET FOR THE KE PEPTIDE IS THE   GENE. PROTEIN PRODUCTS OF THE  ,  , AND   GENES ARE FUNCTIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IL-1Β, IL-6, TNF-Α, IL-4, AND IL-10 CYTOKINES.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE HOW AGEING AND MAJOR GENETIC RISK FACTORS FOR DEMENTIA AFFECT THE HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEOME AND LIPIDOME OF NEUROLOGICALLY-NORMAL HUMANS OVER THE AGE OF 65. THE HIPPOCAMPUS WAS CHOSEN AS IT IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATROPHY WITH AGEING AND IN SEVERAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED PROTEOMIC AND LIPIDOMIC ANALYSIS OF CA1 HIPPOCAMPUS SAMPLES FROM 74 NEUROLOGICALLY NORMAL HUMAN DONORS, AGED 66-104, WAS USED IN COMBINATION WITH MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS AND GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY AGE-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN THE PROTEOME AND LIPIDOME. ANOVA WAS USED TO TEST THE EFFECT OF MAJOR DEMENTIA RISK ALLELES IN THE TMEM106B AND APOE GENES ON THE HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEOME AND LIPIDOME, ADJUSTING FOR AGE, GENDER, AND POST-MORTEM INTERVAL. FIBRILLAR C-TERMINAL TMEM106B FRAGMENTS WERE ISOLATED USING SARKOSYL FRACTIONATION AND QUANTIFIED BY IMMUNOBLOTTING.

FURTHER ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THESE PROTEINS WERE MAINLY INVOLVED IN TRICARBOXYLIC ACID (TCA) CYCLE AND RESPIRATORY ELECTRON TRANSPORT, PROTEASOME DEGRADATION, AND MULTIPLE METABOLIC PATHWAYS AS WELL AS INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING PATHWAYS. SOME PROTEINS, INCLUDING SUCCINATE-COA LIGASE SUBUNIT (SUCLG1), NADH DEHYDROGENASE SUBUNIT 5 (ND5), NADH DEHYDROGENASE [UBIQUINONE] 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX SUBUNIT 4-LIKE 2 (NDUFA4L2) AND CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE ASSEMBLY FACTOR 7 (COA7), WHICH WERE CLOSELY RELATED TO MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY ELECTRON TRANSPORT, SHOWED TMT DOSE AND TIME DEPENDENT CHANGES IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF MICE. MOREOVER, APOPTOTIC MOLECULES BAX AND CLEAVED CASPASE-3 WERE UP-REGULATED, WHILE ANTI-APOPTOTIC BCL-2 WAS DOWN-REGULATED COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. IN CONCLUSION, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IMPAIRMENT OF MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN TRANSPORT AND PROMOTION OF APOPTOSIS ARE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF TMT INDUCED HIPPOCAMPUS TOXICITY IN MICE.","SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;GUANGDONG PROVINCE HOSPITAL FOR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT, GUANGZHOU 510300, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100","NA",0,"1872-9711","NEUROTOXICOLOGY","NEUROTOXICOLOGY",2023,"2023","99","10.1016/j.neuro.2023.10.006","162-176","","","37838251","37838251","PUBMED","SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;GUANGDONG PROVINCE HOSPITAL FOR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT, GUANGZHOU 510300, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100, CHINA.;SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, NORTH SICHUAN MEDICAL COLLEGE, NANCHONG 637100","NA","NA"

HUANGQI-DANSHEN DECOCTION (HDD), A CHINESE HERBAL PREPARATION, HAS BEEN SHOWN BY OUR GROUP TO HAVE A RENO-PROTECTIVE EFFECT IN ADENINE-INDUCED CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE MICE AND DIABETIC   MICE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF HDD ON CISPLATIN-INDUCED AKI AND ITS UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE UNKNOWN.   THE AKI MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED BY INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION OF CISPLATIN (20 MG/KG) IN C57BL/6 MICE. THE MICE IN THE TREATMENT GROUP WERE ADMINISTRATED WITH HDD (6.8 G/KG/D) FOR 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS BEFORE CISPLATIN CHALLENGE. AFTER 72 H CISPLATIN INJECTION, BLOOD AND KIDNEY TISSUE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLECTED FOR BIOCHEMICAL DETECTION, HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVALUATION, WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING, AND TERMINAL DEOXYNUCLEOTIDYL TRANSFERASE (TDT)-MEDIATED DUTP NICK END LABELING ASSAY. ULTRA-HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH QUADRUPOLE TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY WAS USED TO DETECT CHANGES IN RENAL METABOLITES.   THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT HDD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SERUM CREATININE AND BLOOD UREA NITROGEN LEVELS AND ALLEVIATED RENAL HISTOPATHOLOGICAL INJURY IN CISPLATIN-INDUCED AKI MICE. AND HDD TREATMENT DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT INHIBITION IN APOPTOSIS, INFLAMMATION, AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN AKI MICE. MOREOVER, NON-TARGET METABOLOMICS REVEALED THAT HDD SIGNIFICANTLY RESTORED 165 ALTERED METABOLITES IN AKI MICE. SUBSEQUENT ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS AND PATHWAY ANALYSIS OF THESE METABOLITES INDICATED THAT NICOTINATE AND NICOTINAMIDE METABOLISM WAS THE PRIMARY PATHWAY AFFECTED BY HDD INTERVENTION. FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT HDD COULD UPREGULATE NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD ) BIOSYNTHESIS-RELATED ENZYMES QUINOLINATE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE, NICOTINAMIDE MONONUCLEOTIDE ADENYLYLTRANSFERASE 1, AND NICOTINAMIDE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE TO REPLENISH NAD  CONTENT IN THE KIDNEY OF AKI MICE.   IN SUMMARY, HDD EXERTED A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST CISPLATIN-INDUCED AKI AND SUPPRESSED APOPTOSIS, INFLAMMATION, AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN THE KIDNEY OF AKI MICE, WHICH MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MODULATION OF NAD  BIOSYNTHESIS.","DEPARTMENT OF NEPHROLOGY, SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL AFFILIATED TO NANJING UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF NEPHROLOGY, SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.","NA",0,"1663-9812","FRONT PHARMACOL","FRONT PHARMACOL",2023,"2023","14","10.3389/fphar.2023.1236820","1236820","","","38034992","38034992","PUBMED","DEPARTMENT OF NEPHROLOGY, SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL AFFILIATED TO NANJING UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;THE FOURTH CLINICAL MEDICAL COLLEGE, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF NEPHROLOGY, SHENZHEN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITAL, GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA.","NA","NA"

DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-BINDING PROTEINS (DSRBPS) REGULATE INNATE IMMUNITY AND ARE THEREFORE BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN VIRUS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES, HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE IN CERVICAL CANCER IS NOT WELL KNOWN. WE PERFORMED RNA-SEQ OF TUMOR SAMPLES FROM CERVICAL CANCER PATIENTS IN LOCAL COHORT AND ALSO ASSESSED THE RNA-SEQ AND CLINICAL DATA DERIVED FROM PUBLIC DATASETS. BY USING SINGLE SAMPLE GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS (SSGSEA) AND UNIVARIATE COX ANALYSIS, PATIENTS WERE STRATIFIED INTO DISTINCT DSRBP CLUSTERS. STEPWISE COX AND COXBOOST WERE PERFORMED TO CONSTRUCT A RISK MODEL BASED ON OPTIMAL DSRBPS CLUSTERS-RELATED DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES (DEGS), AND GSE44001 AND CGCI-HTMCP-CC WERE EMPLOYED AS TWO EXTERNAL VALIDATION COHORTS. SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING DATA FROM GSE168652 AND SCISSOR ALGORITHM WERE APPLIED TO EVALUATED THE SIGNATURE-RELATED CELL POPULATION. THE EXPRESSION OF DSRBP FEATURES WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HPV INFECTION AND CARCINOGENESIS IN CESC. HOWEVER, ONLY ADENOSINE DEAMINASES ACTING ON RNA (ADAR) AND DICER, DROSHA, AND ARGONAUTES (DDR) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WITH THE OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) OF CESC PATIENTS. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, CESC PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE DSRBP CLUSTERS. CLUSTER 3 SHOWED SUPERIOR OS BUT LOWER LEVELS OF ADAR AND DDR. ADDITIONALLY, CLUSTER 3 DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED INNATE IMMUNITY, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ACTIVITY IN CANCER IMMUNITY CYCLES, IMMUNE SCORES, AND LEVELS OF TUMOR-INFILTRATING IMMUNE CELLS, PARTICULARLY CD8+ T CELLS. FURTHERMORE, A RISK MODEL BASED ON NINE DSRBP CLUSTER-RELATED DEGS WAS ESTABLISHED. THE ACCURACY OF SURVIVAL PREDICTION FOR 1 TO 5 YEARS WAS CONSISTENTLY ABOVE 0.78, AND THIS MODEL'S ROBUST PREDICTIVE CAPACITY WAS CONFIRMED BY TWO EXTERNAL VALIDATION SETS. THE LOW-RISK GROUP EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS OF IMMUNE CHECKPOINTS, SUCH AS PDCD1 AND CTLA4, AS WELL AS A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF CD8+ T CELLS. ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING DATA REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE DSRBP SIGNATURE AND GLYCOLYSIS. IMPORTANTLY, LOW-RISK PATIENTS SHOWED IMPROVED OS AND A HIGHER RESPONSE RATE TO IMMUNOTHERAPY, ALONG WITH ENDURING CLINICAL BENEFITS FROM CONCURRENT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY. DSRBP PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF PROGNOSIS AND TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY IN CERVICAL CANCER, AND ITS PROGNOSTIC SIGNATURE PROVIDES A STRATEGY FOR RISK STRATIFICATION AND IMMUNOTHERAPY EVALUATION.","DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;PRECISION MEDICINE CENTER, YANGTZE DELTA REGION INSTITUTE OF TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, JIAXING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032","NA",0,"1479-5876","J TRANSL MED","J TRANSL MED",2023,"2023","21","10.1186/s12967-023-04505-9","647","","","37735483","37735483","PUBMED","DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;PRECISION MEDICINE CENTER, YANGTZE DELTA REGION INSTITUTE OF TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, JIAXING, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032, CHINA.;DEPARTMENT OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, FUDAN UNIVERSITY SHANGHAI CANCER CENTER, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, NO. 270 DONG'AN ROAD, SHANGHAI, 200032;DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, SHANGHAI MEDICAL COLLEGE, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, 200032","NA","NA"

LEAF SENESCENCE MUTANT IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR EXPLORING MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF AGING. TO DIG FOR POTENTIAL MODULATION NETWORKS DURING MAIZE LEAF AGING PROCESS, WE DELIMITED THE GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PREMATURE LEAF SENESCENCE MUTANT ELS5 TO A 1.1 MB INTERVAL IN THE B73 REFERENCE GENOME USING A BC F  POPULATION WITH 40,000 PLANTS, AND ANALYZED THE LEAF PROTEOMICS OF THE MUTANT AND ITS NEAR-ISOGENIC WILD TYPE LINE. A TOTAL OF 1355 DIFFERENTIALLY ACCUMULATED PROTEINS (DAP) WERE MAINLY ENRICHED IN REGULATION PATHWAYS SUCH AS ""PHOTOSYNTHESIS"", ""RIBOSOME"", AND ""PORPHYRIN AND CHLOROPHYLL METABOLISM"" BY THE KEGG PATHWAY ANALYSIS. THE INTERACTION NETWORKS CONSTRUCTED BY INCORPORATION OF TRANSCRIPTOME DATA SHOWED THAT ZMELS5 LIKELY REPAIRED SEVERAL KEY FACTORS IN THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS SYSTEM. THE PUTATIVE CANDIDATE PROTEINS FOR ELS5 WERE PROPOSED BASED ON DAPS IN THE FINED QTL MAPPING INTERVAL. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR CLONING AND FUNCTIONAL RESEARCH OF THE ELS5 GENE, AND NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF LEAF SENESCENCE IN MAIZE.","STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002","NA",0,"1432-203X","PLANT CELL REP","PLANT CELL REP",2023,"2023","42","10.1007/s00299-023-03051-4","1651-1663","2020M682295;2021YFF100302;32272165","CHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION;NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA;NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA","37498331","37498331","PUBMED","STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002, CHINA.;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WHEAT AND MAIZE CROP SCIENCE, COLLEGE OF AGRONOMY, HENAN AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ZHENGZHOU, 450002","NA","NA"
